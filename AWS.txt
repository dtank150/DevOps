Ans:- (B):- AWS Databse Migration Service

What is Server Composed of?
A rack mount chassis containing a power supply, a system board, one or more CPUs, memory, storage, a network interface and a power supply.	  

It Terminology:-
Network:- Cables, routers and servers connected with each other.
Router:- A networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. They know where to send your packets on the internet!
Switch:- Takes a packet and send it to the correct server / client on your network.

What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, databse storage, applications, and other IT resources
Simply way to access serves,storage,databse and a set of application services.

Deployment Models of the Cloud:-
Private Cloud:- Povider could be Rackspace
Private Cloud:- Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public. 
Complete Control over it
Security for sensitive applications
Meet specific business needs

Public Cloud:-  Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services
Public Cloud:- Cloud resources owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider delivered over the internet.
Six Advantages of Cloud computing

Hybrid Cloud:- Own Infrastructure and the AWS cloud.
Keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the cloud. 
Contorl over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure
Flexibility and cost-effectiveness of the public cloud

The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing
On-demand self service:- Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider
Broad network access:- Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
Multiple-tencey and resource pooling:-Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy 
Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources
Rapid elasticity and scalability:- Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when need
Quickly and easily scale based on demand
Measured Service:-Usage is measured,users pay correctly for what they have used

Six Advantages of Cloud Computing
Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX) :-
Pay on-Demand:- don't own hardware
Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)
Benefit from massive economies of scale:-
Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
Stop guessing capacity:-
Scale based on actual measured usage
Increase speed and agility
Stop spending money running and maintainig data centers
Go global in minutes: leverage the AWS global infrastructure

Types of Cloud Computing:-
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):-
Provide building block for cloud IT
Provides networking, computers, data storage space
Highest level of flexibility
Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT

Platform as a Service (PaaS):-
Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure
Focus on the deployment and management of your applications

Software as a Service (SaaS):-
Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider

Aws Global Infrastructur:-
AWS Regions
AWS Availability Zones
AWS Data Centers
AWS Edge Locations / Points of Presence

AWS Regions:-
AWS has Regions all around the world
Names can be us-east-l, eu-west-3...
A region is a cluster of data centers
Most AWS services are region-scoped

How to choose an AWS Region?
Compliance with data govermence and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission
Proximity:- to customers: reduce latency
Available services within a Region:- new services and new features aren't available in every Region
Pricing:- pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page

AWS Availability Zones:-
Each region has many availability zones (usually 3, min is 3, max is 6). Example:- ap-southeast-2a ap-southeast-2b ap-southeast-2c
Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more dicreate data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity
They're separate from each other, so that thery're isolated from disasters
They're connceted with high bandwith, ultra-low latency networking

AWS has Global Services: 
Identity and Access Management (IAM)
Route 53 (DNS service)
Cloudfront (Content Delivery Network)
WAF (Web Application Firewall)

Most AWS services are Region-scoped:
Amazon EC2 (Infrastructure as a Service)
Elastic Beanstalk (Platform as a Service)
Lambda (Function as a Service)
Rekognition (Software as a Service)

Region Table

IAM:- Users & Groups
IAM = Identity and Access Management, Global service
Root account created by default, shouldn't be used or shared
Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped
Groups only contain users, not other groups
Users don't have to belong to a group, and user can beong to multiple groups

IAM:Permissions:-
Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents'called policies
These policies define the permissions of the users
In AWS you apply the least privilege principle: don't give more permissions than a user needs

IAM Policies Structure:-
Consists of
Version: policy language version, always include "2012-10-17"
Id: an identifier for the policy (optional)
Statement: one or more individual statements (required)
Statement Consists of
Sid: an identifier for the statement (optional)
Effect: whether the statement allows or denies access (Allow, Deny)
Principle: account/user/role to which this policy applied to 
Action: list of actions this policy allows or denies.
Resource: list of resources to which the actions applied to 
Condition: conditions for when this policy is in effect (optional)

IAM - Password Policy
Strong passwords = higher security for your account
In AWS, you can setup a password policy:
Set a minimum password length
Require specific character types:
Including uppercase letter
lowercase letter
numbers
non-alphanumeric characters
Allow all IAM users to change their own passwords
Require users to change their password after some time(password expiration)
Prevent password re-use

Multi Factor Authentication -MFA
Users have access to your account and can possibly change configurations or delete resources in your AWS account
You want to protect your Root Accounts and IAM users
MFA = password you know + security device you own
Main benefit of MFA:
if a password is stolen or hacked, the account is not compromised

MFA devices options in AWS
Virtual MFA device:- 
Google Authenticator, Authy:- Support for multiple tokens on a single device.
Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) Security Key:- YubiKey by Yubico (3rd party):- Support for multiple root and IAM users using a single security key
Hardware Key Fob MFA Device:- Provided by Gemalto (3rd party)
Hardware Key Fob MFA Device for AWS GovCloud(US):- Provided by SurePAssID (3rd party)

How can users access AWS?
To access AWS, you have three options:
AWS Management Console (protected by password + MFA)
AWS Command Line Interface (CLI): Protected by access keys
AWS Software Devloper Kit (SDK)- for code;protected by access keys
Access Keys are generated through the AWS Console
Users manage their own access keys
Access Keys are secret,just like a password.Don't share them
Access Key ID ~= username
Secret Access Key ~= password

What's the AWS CLI?
A tool that enables you to interact with AWS services using commands in your command-line shell
Direct access to the public APIs of AWS services

AWS Software Devlopment Kit (AWS SDK)
Language-specific APIs (set of libraries)
Enables you to access and manage AWS services programmatically
Embedded within your application 
Supports
SDKs (JavaScript, Python, PHP, .NET, Ruby, Java, Go, Node.js, C++)
Mobile SDKs(Android,ios,...)
IOT Device SDKs (Embedded C, Arduino,...)
Example: AWS CLI is built on AWS SDK for Python

IAM Roles for services:-
Some AWS service will need to perform actions on your behalf
To do so, we will assign permission to AWS services with IAM Roles
Common roles:
  EC2 Instance Roles
  Lambda Function Roles
  Roles for CloudFormation
  
IAM Security Tools:-
IAM Credentials Report (account-level)
a report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials

IAM Access Advisor (user-level)
Access advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed.
You can use this information to revise your policies.

Shared Responsibility Model for IAM:-
AWS:-
Insrastruture (global network security)
Configuration and vulnerability analysis
Compliance validation

You:-
User, Groups, Roles, Policies management and monitoring
Enable MFA on all accounts 
Rotate all your keys often
USe IAM tools to apply appropriate permissions
Analyze access patterns & review permissions

Amazon EC2:-
EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS' offering 
EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
It mainly consists in the capability of:
	Renting virtual machines (EC2)
	Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
	Distributing load across machines (ELB)
	Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

EC2 sizing & configuration options
Operating System (OS): Linux, Windows or MAC Os
How much compute power & cores (CPU)
How much random-access memory (RAM)
How much storage space:
	Network-attached (EBS & EFS)
	hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
Network card: speed of the card, Public IP address
Firewall rules: security group
Bootstrap script (configure at first launch): EC2 User Data

EC2 User Data:-
It is possible to bootstrap our instance using an EC2 User data script.
bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
That script is only run once at the instance first start
EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
  Installing updates
  Installing software
  Downloading common files from the internet
  Anything you can think of
 The EC2 User Data script runs with the root user
 
 EC2 Instance Types -Overview
 AWS has the following naming convention:
 m5.2xlarge:-
 m:- instance class
 5:- generation (AWS improves them over time)
 2xlarge:- size within the instance class
 
EC2 Instance Types - General Purpose
Great for a diversity of workloads such as webservers or code repositories
Balance between:
   Compute
   Memory
   Networking

EC2 Instance Types - Compute Optimized
Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors:
     Batch processing workloads
     Media transcoding
     High performance web servers
     High performance computing (HPC)
     Scientific modeling & machine learning
     Dedicated gaming servers
     
EC2 Instance Types - Memory Optimized
Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
Use cases:
  High performance, relational/non-relational databases
  Distributed web scale cache stores
  In-memory databases optimized for BI (bussiness intelligence)
  Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data

EC2 Instance Types - Storage Optimized
Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage
Use cases:
  High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
  Relational & NoSQL databases
  Cache for in-memory databses (for example, Redis)
  Data warehousing applications
  Distributed file systems
  
Introduction to Security Groups:-
Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 Instances.
Security groups only contain allow rules
Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group

Security Groups Deeper Dive
Security groups are acting as a "firewall" on EC2 instances
They regulate:
  Access to Ports
  Authorised IP ranges - IPV4 and IPV6
  Control of inbound network (from other to the instance)
  Control of outbound network (from the instance to other) 

Security Groups
Good to know
Can be attached to multiple instances
Locked down to a region / VPC combination
Does live "outside" the EC2 - if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance won't see it
it's good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access
If your application is not accessible (time out), then it's a security group issue 
If your application gives a "connection refused" error, then it's an application error or it's not launched
All inbound traffic is blocked by default
All outbound traffic is authorised by default

Classic Ports to know
22 = SSH (Secure Shell) -log into a Linux instance
21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol) - upload files into a file share
22 = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) - upload files using SSH
80 = HTTP - access unsecured websites
443 = HTTPS - access secured websites
3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) - Log into a windows instance.
22 is SSH for linux instance 

EC2 Instances Purchasing Options
On-Demand Instances - short workload, predictable pricing, pay by second
Reserved ( 1 & 3 years)
 Reserved Instances - long workloads
 Convertible Reserved Instances - long workloads with flexible instances
Saving Plans ( 1 & 3 years) - commitment to an amount of usage, long workload
Spot Instances - short workloads, cheap, can lose instance (less reliable)
Dedicated Hosts - book an entire physical server, control instance placement
Dedicated Instances - no other customers will share your hardware
Capacity Reservations - reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration

EC2 On Demand
Pay for what you use:
 Linux or Windows - billing per second, after the first minute
 All other operating systems - billing per hour
 Has the highest cost but no upfront payment
 No long-term commitment
 Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads, where you can't predict how the application will behave
 
EC2 Reserved Instances
Up to 72% discount compared to On-demand
You reserve a specific instance attributes (Instance  Type, Region, Tenancy, OS)
Reservation Period - 1 year (+discount) or 3 years (+++discouunt)
Payment Options - No Upfront (+), Partial Upfront (++), All Upfront (+++)
Reserved Instance's Scope - Regional or Zonal (reserve capacity in an AZ)
Recommended for steady-state usage applications (think database)
You can buy and sell in the Reserved Instance Marketplace

Convertible Reserved Instance:-
Can change the EC2 instance type, instance family, OS, scope and tenancy
Up to 66% discount
Note:- The % discounts are different from the video as AWS change them over time-the exact numbers are not needed for the exam. This is just for illustrative purpose

EC2 Saving Plans:-
Get a discount based on long-term usage (up to 72% -same as Rls)
Commit to a certain type of usage ($10/hour for 1 or 3 years)
Usage beyond EC2 Savings Plan is billed at the On-Demand price

Locked to a specific instance family & AWS region (e.g., M5 in us-east-l)
Flexible across:
   Instance Size (e.g.,m5.xlarge,m5.2xlarge)
   OS(e.g., Linux, Windows)
   Tenancy (Host, Dedicated, Default)

EC2 Spot Instances:-
Can get a discount of up to 90% compared to On-demand
Instances that you can "lose" at any point of time if your max price is less than the current spot price
The MOST cost-efficient instances in AWS
Useful for workloads that are resilient to failur
   Batch jobs
   Data analysis
   Image processing
   Any distributed workloads
   Workloads with a flexible start and end time

Not suitable for critical jobs or databses

EC2 Dedicated Hosts:-
A physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use 
Allows you address compliance requirements and use your existing server-bound software licenses (per-socket, per-core, pe-VM software licenses)
Purchasing Options:
   On-demand - pay per second for active Dedicated Host
   Reserved - 1 or 3 years (No Upfront, Partial Upfront, All Upfront)
The most expensive option
Useful for software that have complicated licensing model (BYOL - Bring Your Own License)
Or for companies that have strong regulatory or compliance needs

EC2 Dedicated Instances:-
Instances run on hardware that's dedicated to you
May share hardware with other instances in same account
No control over instance placement (can move hardwae after Stop / Start)

EC2 Capacity Reservations:-
Reserve On-Demand instances capacity in a specific AZ for any duration
You always have access to EC2 capacity when you need it
No time commitment (create/cancle anytime), no billing discounts
Combine with Regional Reserved Instances and Savings Plans to benifit from billing discounts
You're charged at On-Demand rate whether you run instances or not 
Suitable for short-term, uninterrupted workloads that needs to be in a specific AZ

Shared Responsibility Model for EC2:-
AWS:-
Infrstructure (global network security)
Isolation on physical hosts
Replacing faulty hardware
Compliance validation

User:-
Security Groups rules 
Operating-System patches and updates 
Software and utilities installed on the EC2 instance
IAM Roles assigned to EC2 & IAM user access management 
Data security on your instance

What's an EBS Volume?
An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run
It allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination
They can only be mounted to one instance at a time (At the CCP level)
They are bound to a specific availbility zone

Anlogy: Think of them as a "network USB stick"
Free tier: 30GB of free EBS storage of tyep General Purpose (SSD) or Magnetic per month

EBS Volume:-
It's a network drive (i.e. not a physical drive)
  It users the network to communicate the instance, which means threre might be a bit of latency
  It can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly
  
It's locked to an Availability Zone (AZ)
  An EBS Volume in us-east-l a connot be attached to us-east-l b
  To move a voulme across, you first need to snapshot it 

Have a provisioned capacity (size in GBs, and IOPS)
  you get billed for all the provisioned capacity
  you can increase the capacity of the drive over time

EBS - Delete on Termination attribute:-
Controls the EBS behaviour when an EC2 instance terminates
 By default, the root EBS volume is deleted (attribute enabled)
 By default, any othey attached EBS volume is not deleted (Attribute disabled)
This can be controlled by the AWS console /AWS CLI
Use case: preserve root volume when instamce is terminated

EBS Snapshots:-
MAke a backup (snapshot) of your EBS volume at a point in time
Not necessary to detach volume to do snapshot, but recommanded 
Can copy sanpshorts across AZ or Region
 
 EBS Snapshots Features:-
 EBS Sanpshot Archive:-
   Move a snapshot to an "archive tier" that is 75% cheaper
   Takes within 24 to 72 hourse for restoring the archive

Recycle Bin for EBS Snapshots:-
  Setup rules to retain deleted snapshots so you can recover them after an accidental deletion
  Specify retention (from 1 day to 1 year)

AMI Overview:-
AMI = Amazon MAchine Image
AMI are a customization of an EC2 instance
 You add your own software, configuration, operating system, monitoring...
 Faster boot/ configuration time because all your software is pre-packedged
AMI are built for a specific region (and can be copied across regions)
You can launch EC2 instances from:
   A public AMI:- AWS provided
   Your own AMI:- you make and maintain them yourself
   An AWS Marketplace AMI:- an AMI someone else made (and potentially sells)

AMI Process (from an EC2 instance):-
Start an EC2 instance and customize it
Stop the instance (for data integrity)
Build an AMI - this will also create EBS snapshots
Launch instances from other AMIs

EC2 Image Builder:-
Used to automate the creation of Virtual MAchines or container images
=> Automate the createion, maintain, validate and test EC2 AMIs

EC2 Instance Store:-
EBS volumes are network drives with good but "limited" performance
If you need a high-performance hardware disk,use EC2 Instance Store

Better I/O performance
EC2 Instance Store lose their storage if they're stopped (ephemeral)
Good for buffer / cache / scratch data /temporary content
Risk of data loss if hardware fails
Backups and Replication are your responsibility

EFS - Elastic File System:-
Managed NFS (Network File System) that can be mounted on 100 of EC2
EFS works with Linux EC2 instances in multi-AZ
Highly available, scalable, expensive (3x gp2), pay per use, no capacity planning

EFS Infrequent Access (EFS-IA):-
Storage class that is cost-optimized for files not accessed every day
Up to 92% lower cost compared to EFS Standard
EFS will automatically move your files to EFS-IA based on the last time they were accessed
Enable EFS-IA with a Lifecycle Policy
Example:- move files that are not accessed for 60 days to EFS-IA
Transparent to the applications accessing EFS

Amazon FSx - Overview
Launch 3rd party high-performance file systems on AWS
Fully managed service
Fsx for Lustre, Fsx for Windows File Server Fsx for NetApp ONTAP

Amazon FSx for Windows File Server:-
A fully managed, highly reliable, and scalable Windows native shared file system
Built on Windows File Server
Supports SMB protocol & Windows NTFS
Integrated with Microsoft Active Directory
Can be accessed from AWS or your on-premise infrastructure

Amazon FSx for Lustre:-
A fully high-performance, scalable file storage for High Performance Computing (HPC)
The name Lustre is derived from "Linux" and "cluster"
Machine Learning, Analytics, Video Processing, Financial Modeling,...
Scales up to 100s GB/s, millions of IOPS, sub-ms latencies

Scalability & High Availability:-
Scalability means that an appluication / system can handle greater loads by adapting.
There are two kinds of scalability:-
	Vertical Scalability
	Horizonatal Scalability (= elasticity)

Scalability is linked but different to High availablility

Vertical Scalability:-
Vertical Scalability means increasing the size of the instance
For example, your application runs on a t2.micro
Scaling that application vertically means running it on a t2.large
Vertical scalability is very common for non distributed systems, such as a database.
There's usually a limit to how much you can vertically scale (hardware limit) 

Horizontal Scalability:-
Horizontal Scalability means increasing the number of instances / systems for your application
Horizontal scaling implies distributed systems.
This is very common for web applications / modern applications

High Availability:-
