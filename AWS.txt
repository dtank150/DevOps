A) AWS Storage Getwy
B) AWS Dtabase Migration Service => Ans
C) Amazon EC2
D) Amazon AppStream 2.0

Ans:- (B):- AWS Databse Migration Service

What is Server Composed of?
A rack mount chassis containing a power supply, a system board, one or more CPUs, memory, storage, a network interface and a power supply.	  

It Terminology:-
Network:- Cables, routers and servers connected with each other.
Router:- A networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. They know where to send your packets on the internet!
Switch:- Takes a packet and send it to the correct server / client on your network.

What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, databse storage, applications, and other IT resources
Simply way to access serves,storage,databse and a set of application services.

Deployment Models of the Cloud:-
Private Cloud:- Povider could be Rackspace
Private Cloud:- Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public. 
Complete Control over it
Security for sensitive applications
Meet specific business needs

Public Cloud:-  Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services
Public Cloud:- Cloud resources owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider delivered over the internet.
Six Advantages of Cloud computing

Hybrid Cloud:- Own Infrastructure and the AWS cloud.
Keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the cloud. 
Contorl over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure
Flexibility and cost-effectiveness of the public cloud

The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing
On-demand self service:- Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider
Broad network access:- Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
Multiple-tencey and resource pooling:-Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy 
Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources
Rapid elasticity and scalability:- Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when need
Quickly and easily scale based on demand
Measured Service:-Usage is measured,users pay correctly for what they have used

Six Advantages of Cloud Computing
Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX) :-
Pay on-Demand:- don't own hardware
Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)
Benefit from massive economies of scale:-
Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
Stop guessing capacity:-
Scale based on actual measured usage
Increase speed and agility
Stop spending money running and maintainig data centers
Go global in minutes: leverage the AWS global infrastructure

Types of Cloud Computing:-
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):-
Provide building block for cloud IT
Provides networking, computers, data storage space
Highest level of flexibility
Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT

Platform as a Service (PaaS):-
Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure
Focus on the deployment and management of your applications

Software as a Service (SaaS):-
Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider

Aws Global Infrastructur:-
AWS Regions
AWS Availability Zones
AWS Data Centers
AWS Edge Locations / Points of Presence

AWS Regions:-
AWS has Regions all around the world
Names can be us-east-l, eu-west-3...
A region is a cluster of data centers
Most AWS services are region-scoped

How to choose an AWS Region?
Compliance with data govermence and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission
Proximity:- to customers: reduce latency
Available services within a Region:- new services and new features aren't available in every Region
Pricing:- pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page

AWS Availability Zones:-
Each region has many availability zones (usually 3, min is 3, max is 6). Example:- ap-southeast-2a ap-southeast-2b ap-southeast-2c
Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more dicreate data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity
They're separate from each other, so that thery're isolated from disasters
They're connceted with high bandwith, ultra-low latency networking

AWS has Global Services: 
Identity and Access Management (IAM)
Route 53 (DNS service)
Cloudfront (Content Delivery Network)
WAF (Web Application Firewall)

Most AWS services are Region-scoped:
Amazon EC2 (Infrastructure as a Service)
Elastic Beanstalk (Platform as a Service)
Lambda (Function as a Service)
Rekognition (Software as a Service)

Region Table

IAM:- Users & Groups
IAM = Identity and Access Management, Global service
Root account created by default, shouldn't be used or shared
Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped
Groups only contain users, not other groups
Users don't have to belong to a group, and user can beong to multiple groups

IAM:Permissions:-
Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents'called policies
These policies define the permissions of the users
In AWS you apply the least privilege principle: don't give more permissions than a user needs

IAM Policies Structure:-
Consists of
Version: policy language version, always include "2012-10-17"
Id: an identifier for the policy (optional)
Statement: one or more individual statements (required)
Statement Consists of
Sid: an identifier for the statement (optional)
Effect: whether the statement allows or denies access (Allow, Deny)
Principle: account/user/role to which this policy applied to 
Action: list of actions this policy allows or denies.
Resource: list of resources to which the actions applied to 
Condition: conditions for when this policy is in effect (optional)

IAM - Password Policy
Strong passwords = higher security for your account
In AWS, you can setup a password policy:
Set a minimum password length
Require specific character types:
Including uppercase letter
lowercase letter
numbers
non-alphanumeric characters
Allow all IAM users to change their own passwords
Require users to change their password after some time(password expiration)
Prevent password re-use

Multi Factor Authentication -MFA
Users have access to your account and can possibly change configurations or delete resources in your AWS account
You want to protect your Root Accounts and IAM users
MFA = password you know + security device you own
Main benefit of MFA:
if a password is stolen or hacked, the account is not compromised

MFA devices options in AWS
Virtual MFA device:- 
Google Authenticator, Authy:- Support for multiple tokens on a single device.
Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) Security Key:- YubiKey by Yubico (3rd party):- Support for multiple root and IAM users using a single security key
Hardware Key Fob MFA Device:- Provided by Gemalto (3rd party)
Hardware Key Fob MFA Device for AWS GovCloud(US):- Provided by SurePAssID (3rd party)

How can users access AWS?
To access AWS, you have three options:
AWS Management Console (protected by password + MFA)
AWS Command Line Interface (CLI): Protected by access keys
AWS Software Devloper Kit (SDK)- for code;protected by access keys
Access Keys are generated through the AWS Console
Users manage their own access keys
Access Keys are secret,just like a password.Don't share them
Access Key ID ~= username
Secret Access Key ~= password

What's the AWS CLI?
A tool that enables you to interact with AWS services using commands in your command-line shell
Direct access to the public APIs of AWS services

AWS Software Devlopment Kit (AWS SDK)
Language-specific APIs (set of libraries)
Enables you to access and manage AWS services programmatically
Embedded within your application 
Supports
SDKs (JavaScript, Python, PHP, .NET, Ruby, Java, Go, Node.js, C++)
Mobile SDKs(Android,ios,...)
IOT Device SDKs (Embedded C, Arduino,...)
Example: AWS CLI is built on AWS SDK for Python

IAM Roles for services:-
Some AWS service will need to perform actions on your behalf
To do so, we will assign permission to AWS services with IAM Roles
Common roles:
  EC2 Instance Roles
  Lambda Function Roles
  Roles for CloudFormation
  
IAM Security Tools:-
IAM Credentials Report (account-level)
a report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials

IAM Access Advisor (user-level)
Access advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed.
You can use this information to revise your policies.

Shared Responsibility Model for IAM:-
AWS:-
Insrastruture (global network security)
Configuration and vulnerability analysis
Compliance validation

You:-
User, Groups, Roles, Policies management and monitoring
Enable MFA on all accounts 
Rotate all your keys often
USe IAM tools to apply appropriate permissions
Analyze access patterns & review permissions

Amazon EC2:-
EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS' offering 
EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
It mainly consists in the capability of:
	Renting virtual machines (EC2)
	Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
	Distributing load across machines (ELB)
	Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

EC2 sizing & configuration options
Operating System (OS): Linux, Windows or MAC Os
How much compute power & cores (CPU)
How much random-access memory (RAM)
How much storage space:
	Network-attached (EBS & EFS)
	hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
Network card: speed of the card, Public IP address
Firewall rules: security group
Bootstrap script (configure at first launch): EC2 User Data

EC2 User Data:-
It is possible to bootstrap our instance using an EC2 User data script.
bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
That script is only run once at the instance first start
EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
  Installing updates
  Installing software
  Downloading common files from the internet
  Anything you can think of
 The EC2 User Data script runs with the root user
 
 EC2 Instance Types -Overview
 AWS has the following naming convention:
 m5.2xlarge:-
 m:- instance class
 5:- generation (AWS improves them over time)
 2xlarge:- size within the instance class
 
EC2 Instance Types - General Purpose
Great for a diversity of workloads such as webservers or code repositories
Balance between:
   Compute
   Memory
   Networking

EC2 Instance Types - Compute Optimized
Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors:
     Batch processing workloads
     Media transcoding
     High performance web servers
     High performance computing (HPC)
     Scientific modeling & machine learning
     Dedicated gaming servers
     
EC2 Instance Types - Memory Optimized
Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
Use cases:
  High performance, relational/non-relational databases
  Distributed web scale cache stores
  In-memory databases optimized for BI (bussiness intelligence)
  Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data

EC2 Instance Types - Storage Optimized

Use cases:
  High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
  Relational & NoSQL databases
  Cache for in-memory databses (for example, Redis)
  Data warehousing applications
  Distributed file systems
  
Introduction to Security Groups:-
Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 Instances.
Security groups only contain allow rules
Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group

Security Groups Deeper Dive
Security groups are acting as a "firewall" on EC2 instances
They regulate:
  Access to Ports
  Authorised IP ranges - IPV4 and IPV6
  Control of inbound network (from other to the instance)
  Control of outbound network (from the instance to other) 

Security Groups
Good to know
Can be attached to multiple instances
Locked down to a region / VPC combination
Does live "outside" the EC2 - if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance won't see it
it's good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access
If your application is not accessible (time out), then it's a security group issue 
If your application gives a "connection refused" error, then it's an application error or it's not launched
All inbound traffic is blocked by default
All outbound traffic is authorised by default

Classic Ports to know
22 = SSH (Secure Shell) -log into a Linux instance
21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol) - upload files into a file share
22 = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) - upload files using SSH
80 = HTTP - access unsecured websites
443 = HTTPS - access secured websites
3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) - Log into a windows instance.
22 is SSH for linux instance 

EC2 Instances Purchasing Options
On-Demand Instances - short workload, predictable pricing, pay by second
Reserved ( 1 & 3 years)
 Reserved Instances - long workloads
 Convertible Reserved Instances - long workloads with flexible instances
Saving Plans ( 1 & 3 years) - commitment to an amount of usage, long workload
Spot Instances - short workloads, cheap, can lose instance (less reliable)
Dedicated Hosts - book an entire physical server, control instance placement
Dedicated Instances - no other customers will share your hardware
Capacity Reservations - reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration

EC2 On Demand
Pay for what you use:
 Linux or Windows - billing per second, after the first minute
 All other operating systems - billing per hour
 Has the highest cost but no upfront payment
 No long-term commitment
 Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads, where you can't predict how the application will behave
 
EC2 Reserved Instances
Up to 72% discount compared to On-demand
You reserve a specific instance attributes (Instance  Type, Region, Tenancy, OS)
Reservation Period - 1 year (+discount) or 3 years (+++discouunt)

Allows you address compliance requirements and use your existing server-bound software licenses (per-socket, per-core, pe-VM software licenses)
Purchasing Options:
   On-demand - pay per second for active Dedicated Host
   Reserved - 1 or 3 years (No Upfront, Partial Upfront, All Upfront)
The most expensive option
Useful for software that have complicated licensing model (BYOL - Bring Your Own License)
Or for companies that have strong regulatory or compliance needs

EC2 Dedicated Instances:-
Instances run on hardware that's dedicated to you
May share hardware with other instances in same account
No control over instance placement (can move hardwae after Stop / Start)

EC2 Capacity Reservations:-
Reserve On-Demand instances capacity in a specific AZ for any duration
You always have access to EC2 capacity when you need it
No time commitment (create/cancle anytime), no billing discounts
Combine with Regional Reserved Instances and Savings Plans to benifit from billing discounts
You're charged at On-Demand rate whether you run instances or not 
Suitable for short-term, uninterrupted workloads that needs to be in a specific AZ

Shared Responsibility Model for EC2:-
AWS:-
Infrstructure (global network security)
Isolation on physical hosts
Replacing faulty hardware
Compliance validation

User:-
Security Groups rules 
Operating-System patches and updates 
Software and utilities installed on the EC2 instance
IAM Roles assigned to EC2 & IAM user access management 
Data security on your instance

What's an EBS Volume?
An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run
It allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination
They can only be mounted to one instance at a time (At the CCP level)
They are bound to a specific availbility zone

Anlogy: Think of them as a "network USB stick"
Free tier: 30GB of free EBS storage of tyep General Purpose (SSD) or Magnetic per month

EBS Volume:-
It's a network drive (i.e. not a physical drive)
  It users the network to communicate the instance, which means threre might be a bit of latency
  It can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly
  
It's locked to an Availability Zone (AZ)
  An EBS Volume in us-east-l a connot be attached to us-east-l b
  To move a voulme across, you first need to snapshot it 

Have a provisioned capacity (size in GBs, and IOPS)
  you get billed for all the provisioned capacity
  you can increase the capacity of the drive over time

EBS - Delete on Termination attribute:-
Controls the EBS behaviour when an EC2 instance terminates
 By default, the root EBS volume is deleted (attribute enabled)
 By default, any othey attached EBS volume is not deleted (Attribute disabled)
This can be controlled by the AWS console /AWS CLI
Use case: preserve root volume when instamce is terminated

EBS Snapshots:-
MAke a backup (snapshot) of your EBS volume at a point in time
Not necessary to detach volume to do snapshot, but recommanded 
Can copy sanpshorts across AZ or Region
 
 EBS Snapshots Features:-
 EBS Sanpshot Archive:-
   Move a snapshot to an "archive tier" that is 75% cheaper
   Takes within 24 to 72 hourse for restoring the archive

Recycle Bin for EBS Snapshots:-
  Setup rules to retain deleted snapshots so you can recover them after an accidental deletion
  Specify retention (from 1 day to 1 year)

AMI Overview:-
AMI = Amazon MAchine Image
AMI are a customization of an EC2 instance
 You add your own software, configuration, operating system, monitoring...
 Faster boot/ configuration time because all your software is pre-packedged
AMI are built for a specific region (and can be copied across regions)
You can launch EC2 instances from:
   A public AMI:- AWS provided
   Your own AMI:- you make and maintain them yourself
   An AWS Marketplace AMI:- an AMI someone else made (and potentially sells)

AMI Process (from an EC2 instance):-
Start an EC2 instance and customize it
Stop the instance (for data integrity)
Build an AMI - this will also create EBS snapshots
Launch instances from other AMIs

EC2 Image Builder:-
Used to automate the creation of Virtual MAchines or container images
=> Automate the createion, maintain, validate and test EC2 AMIs

EC2 Instance Store:-
EBS volumes are network drives with good but "limited" performance
If you need a high-performance hardware disk,use EC2 Instance Store

Better I/O performance
EC2 Instance Store lose their storage if they're stopped (ephemeral)
Good for buffer / cache / scratch data /temporary content
Risk of data loss if hardware fails
Backups and Replication are your responsibility

EFS - Elastic File System:-
Managed NFS (Network File System) that can be mounted on 100 of EC2
EFS works with Linux EC2 instances in multi-AZ
Highly available, scalable, expensive (3x gp2), pay per use, no capacity planning

EFS Infrequent Access (EFS-IA):-
Storage class that is cost-optimized for files not accessed every day
Up to 92% lower cost compared to EFS Standard
EFS will automatically move your files to EFS-IA based on the last time they were accessed
Enable EFS-IA with a Lifecycle Policy
Example:- move files that are not accessed for 60 days to EFS-IA
Transparent to the applications accessing EFS

Amazon FSx - Overview
Launch 3rd party high-performance file systems on AWS
Fully managed service
Fsx for Lustre, Fsx for Windows File Server Fsx for NetApp ONTAP

Amazon FSx for Windows File Server:-
A fully managed, highly reliable, and scalable Windows native shared file system
Built on Windows File Server

The name Lustre is derived from "Linux" and "cluster"
Machine Learning, Analytics, Video Processing, Financial Modeling,...
Scales up to 100s GB/s, millions of IOPS, sub-ms latencies

Scalability & High Availability:-
Scalability means that an appluication / system can handle greater loads by adapting.
There are two kinds of scalability:-
	Vertical Scalability
	Horizonatal Scalability (= elasticity)

Scalability is linked but different to High availablility

Vertical Scalability:-
Vertical Scalability means increasing the size of the instance
For example, your application runs on a t2.micro
Scaling that application vertically means running it on a t2.large
Vertical scalability is very common for non distributed systems, such as a database.
There's usually a limit to how much you can vertically scale (hardware limit) 

Horizontal Scalability:-
Horizontal Scalability means increasing the number of instances / systems for your application
Horizontal scaling implies distributed systems.
This is very common for web applications / modern applications

High Availability:-
High Availability usually goes hand in hand with horizontal scaling
High availability means running your application / system in at least 2 Availability Zones

High Availability & Scalability For EC2:-
Vertical Scaling: Increase instance size (= scale up / down)
    From: t2.nano - 0.5G of RAM, 1 vCPU
    To: u-12tb1.metal – 12.3 TB of RAM, 448 vCPUs
Horizontal Scaling: Increase number of instances (= scale out / in)
    Auto Scaling Group
    Load Balancer
High Availability: Run instances for the same application across multi AZ
   Auto Scaling Group multi AZ
   Load Balancer multi AZ

Scalability vs Elasticity (vs Agility)
Scalability: ability to accommodate a larger load by making the hardware stronger (scale up), or by adding nodes (scale out)
Elasticity: once a system is scalable, elasticity means that there will be some “auto-scaling” so that the system can scale based on the load. This is “cloud-friendly”: pay-per-use, match demand, optimize costs
Agility: (not related to scalability - distractor) new IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes.

What is load balancing?
Load balancers are servers that forward internet traffic to multiple servers (EC2 Instances) downstream.

Why use a load balancer?
Spread load across multiple downstream instances
Expose a single point of access (DNS) to your application
Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances
Do regular health checks to your instances
Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for your websites
High availability across zones

Why use an Elastic Load Balancer?
An ELB (Elastic Load Balancer) is a managed load balancer
	AWS guarantees that it will be working
	AWS takes care of upgrades, maintenance, high availability
	AWS provides only a few configuration knobs

It costs less to setup your own load balancer but it will be a lot more effort on your end (maintenance, integrations)
4 kinds of load balancers offered by AWS:
	Application Load Balancer (HTTP / HTTPS only)
	Network Load Balancer (ultra-high performance, allows for TCP) 
	Gateway Load Balancer
	Classic Load Balancer 

What’s an Auto Scaling Group?
The goal of an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) is to:
	Scale out (add EC2 instances) to match an increased load
	Scale in (remove EC2 instances) to match a decreased load
	Ensure we have a minimum and a maximum number of machines running
	Automatically register new instances to a load balancer
	Replace unhealthy instances

Cost Savings: only run at an optimal capacity (principle of the cloud)

Auto Scaling Groups – Scaling Strategies
Manual Scaling: Update the size of an ASG manually
Dynamic Scaling: Respond to changing demand
 Simple / Step Scaling
	 When a CloudWatch alarm is triggered (example CPU > 70%), then add 2 units
	 When a CloudWatch alarm is triggered (example CPU < 30%), then remove 1
 Target Tracking Scaling
	 Example: I want the average ASG CPU to stay at around 40%
 Scheduled Scaling
	 Anticipate a scaling based on known usage patterns
	 Example: increase the min. capacity to 10 at 5 pm on Fridays

Auto Scaling Groups – Scaling Strategies
Predictive Scaling:- 
    Uses Machine Learning to predict future traffic ahead of time
Automatically
    provisions the right number of EC2 instances in advance

Amazon S3:-
Amazon S3 is one of the main building blocks of AWS
It’s advertised as ”infinitely scaling” storage

Amazon S3 Use cases:-
  Backup and storage
  Disaster Recovery
  Archive
  Hybrid Cloud storage
  Application hosting
  Media hosting
  Data lakes & big data analytics
  Software delivery
  Static website

Amazon S3 - Buckets:-
Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) in “buckets” (directories)
Buckets must have a globally unique name (across all regions all accounts)
Buckets are defined at the region level
S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region

Amazon S3 - Objects:-
Objects (files) have a Key
The key is composed of prefix + object name
s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt
Just keys with very long names that contain slashes (“/”)
Object values are the content of the body:
  Max. Object Size is 5TB (5000GB)
  If uploading more than 5GB, must use “multi-part upload”
Metadata (list of text key / value pairs – system or user metadata)
Tags (Unicode key / value pair – up to 10) – useful for security / lifecycle
Version ID (if versioning is enabled)

Amazon S3 – Security:-
User-Based
  IAM Policies – which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM
Resource-Based
  Bucket Policies – bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account
  Object Access Control List (ACL) – finer grain (can be disabled)
  Bucket Access Control List (ACL) – less common (can be disabled)
Encryption: encrypt objects in Amazon S3 using encryption keys

S3 Bucket Policies:-
JSON based policies
   Resources: buckets and objects
   Effect: Allow / Deny
   Actions: Set of API to Allow or Deny
   Principal: The account or user to apply the policy to

Use S3 bucket for policy to:
  Grant public access to the bucket
  Force objects to be encrypted at upload
  Grant access to another account (Cross Account)
  
Amazon S3 – Replication (CRR & SRR)
Must enable Versioning in source and destination buckets
Cross-Region Replication (CRR)
Same-Region Replication (SRR)
Buckets can be in different AWS accounts
Copying is asynchronous
Must give proper IAM permissions to S3
Use cases:
 CRR – compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts
 SRR – log aggregation, live replication between production and test accounts

What is Docker?
Docker is a software development platform to deploy apps
Apps are packaged in containers that can be run on any OS
Apps run the same, regardless of where they’re run
	Any machine
	No compatibility issues
	Predictable behavior
	Less work
	Easier to maintain and deploy
	Works with any language, any OS, any technology
Scale containers up and down very quickly (seconds)
Docker images are stored in Docker Repositories

Docker versus Virtual Machines:-
Docker is ”sort of ” a virtualization technology, but not exactly
Resources are shared with the host => many containers on one server

ECS:-
ECS = Elastic Container Service
Launch Docker containers on AWS
You must provision & maintain the infrastructure (the EC2 instances)
AWS takes care of starting / stopping containers
Has integrations with the Application Load Balancer

Fargate:-
Launch Docker containers on AWS
You do not provision the infrastructure (no EC2 instances to manage) – simpler!
Serverless offering
AWS just runs containers for you based on the CPU / RAM you need

ECR:-
Elastic Container Registry
Private Docker Registry on AWS
This is where you store your Docker images so they can be run by ECS or Fargate

Why AWS Lambda:-
• Virtual Servers in the Cloud
• Limited by RAM and CPU
• Continuously running
• Scaling means intervention to add / remove servers

• Virtual functions – no servers to manage!
• Limited by time - shor t executions
• Run on-demand
• Scaling is automated!

Benefits of AWS Lambda:-
Easy Pricing:
   Pay per request and compute time
   Free tier of 1,000,000 AWS Lambda requests and 400,000 GBs of compute time
Integrated with the whole AWS suite of services
Event-Driven: functions get invoked by AWS when needed
Integrated with many programming languages
Easy monitoring through AWS CloudWatch
Easy to get more resources per functions (up to 10GB of RAM!)
Increasing RAM will also improve CPU and network!

Amazon API Gateway:-
Fully managed service for developers to easily create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs
Serverless and scalable
Supports RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs
Support for security, user authentication, API throttling, API keys, monitoring...

AWS Batch:-
Fully managed batch processing at any scale
Efficiently run 100,000s of computing batch jobs on AWS
A “batch” job is a job with a start and an end (opposed to continuous)
Batch will dynamically launch EC2 instances or Spot Instances
AWS Batch provisions the right amount of compute / memory
You submit or schedule batch jobs and AWS Batch does the rest!
Batch jobs are defined as Docker images and run on ECS
Helpful for cost optimizations and focusing less on the infrastructure

Batch vs Lambda:-
Lambda:-
  Time limit
  Limited runtimes
  Limited temporary disk space
  Serverless
  
Batch:-
  No time limit
  Any runtime as long as it’s packaged as a Docker image
  Rely on EBS / instance store for disk space
  Relies on EC2 (can be managed by AWS)
  
Amazon Lightsail:-
Virtual servers, storage, databases, and networking
Low & predictable pricing
Simpler alternative to using EC2, RDS, ELB, EBS, Route 53…
Great for people with little cloud experience!
Can setup notifications and monitoring of your Lightsail resources

Use cases:-
  Simple web applications (has templates for LAMP, Nginx, MEAN, Node.js…)
  Websites (templates for WordPress, Magento, Plesk, Joomla)
  Dev / Test environment
  
Has high availability but no auto-scaling, limited AWS integrations

Summary:-
Docker : container technology to run applications
ECS: run Docker containers on EC2 instances
Fargate:
  Run Docker containers without provisioning the infrastructure
  Serverless offering (no EC2 instances)
ECR: Private Docker Images Repository
Batch: run batch jobs on AWS across managed EC2 instances
Lightsail: predictable & low pricing for simple application & DB stacks

Lambda Summary:-
• Lambda is Serverless, Function as a Service, seamless scaling, reactive
• Lambda Billing:
• By the time run x by the RAM provisioned
• By the number of invocations
• Language Suppor t: many programming languages except (arbitrary) Docker
• Invocation time: up to 15 minutes
• Use cases:
• Create Thumbnails for images uploaded onto S3
• Run a Serverless cron job
• API Gateway: expose Lambda functions as HTTP API

What is CloudFormation:-
CloudFormation is a declarative way of outlining your AWS Infrastructure, for any resources (most of them are supported).
Then CloudFormation creates those for you, in the right order, with the exact configuration that you specify

Benefits of AWS CloudFormation:-
Infrastructure as code:-
   • No resources are manually created, which is excellent for control
   • Changes to the infrastructure are reviewed through code
Cost:-
   • Each resources within the stack is tagged with an identifier so you can easily see how much a stack costs you
   • You can estimate the costs of your resources using the CloudFormation template
   • Savings strategy: In Dev, you could automation deletion of templates at 5 PM and recreated at 8 AM, safely
Productivity:-
   • Ability to destroy and re-create an infrastructure on the cloud on the fly
   • Automated generation of Diagram for your templates!
   • Declarative programming (no need to figure out ordering and orchestration)
Don’t re-invent the wheel:-
   • Leverage existing templates on the web!
   • Leverage the documentation
Suppor ts (almost) all AWS resources:-
   • Everything we’ll see in this course is supported
   • You can use “custom resources” for resources that are not supported
   
AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK):-
Define your cloud infrastructure using a familiar language:
  • JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java, and .NET
The code is “compiled” into a CloudFormation template (JSON/YAML)
You can therefore deploy infrastructure and application runtime code together
  • Great for Lambda functions
  • Great for Docker containers in ECS / EKS
  
AWS Elastic Beanstalk Overview:-
Elastic Beanstalk is a developer centric view of deploying an application on AWS
It uses all the component’s we’ve seen before: EC2, ASG, ELB, RDS, etc…
But it’s all in one view that’s easy to make sense of!
We still have full control over the configuration
Beanstalk = Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Beanstalk is free but you pay for the underlying instances

Managed service:-
  Instance configuration / OS is handled by Beanstalk
  Deployment strategy is configurable but performed by Elastic Beanstalk
  Capacity provisioning
  Load balancing & auto-scaling
  Application health-monitoring & responsiveness

Three architecture models:-
  • Single Instance deployment: good for dev
  • LB + ASG: great for production or pre-production web applications

Fully managed, compatible with CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, Elastic Beanstalk,CloudFormation, GitHub, 3rd-party services (GitHub…) & custom plugins…
Fast delivery & rapid updates

AWS CodeArtifact:-
Software packages depend on each other to be built (also called code dependencies), and new ones are created
Storing and retrieving these dependencies is called ar tifact management
Traditionally you need to setup your own artifact management system
CodeAr tifact is a secure, scalable, and cost-effective ar tifact management for software development
Works with common dependency management tools such as Maven, Gradle, npm, yarn, twine, pip, and NuGet
Developers and CodeBuild can then retrieve dependencies straight from CodeArtifact

AWS CodeStar:-
Unified UI to easily manage software development activities in one place
“Quick way” to get started to correctly set-up CodeCommit, CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, etc…
Can edit the code ”in-the-cloud” using AWS Cloud9

AWS Cloud9:-
AWS Cloud9 is a cloud IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for writing, running and debugging code
“Classic” IDE (like IntelliJ, Visual Studio Code…) are downloaded on a computer before being used
A cloud IDE can be used within a web browser, meaning you can work on your projects from your office, home, or anywhere with internet with no setup necessary
AWS Cloud9 also allows for code collaboration in real-time (pair programming)

AWS Systems Manager (SSM):-

Why make a global application?
A global application is an application deployed in multiple geographies
On AWS: this could be Regions and / or Edge Locations
Decreased Latency:-
  • Latency is the time it takes for a network packet to reach a server
  • It takes time for a packet from Asia to reach the US
  • Deploy your applications closer to your users to decrease latency, better experience
Disaster Recovery (DR)
  • If an AWS region goes down (earthquake, storms, power shutdown, politics)…
  • You can fail-over to another region and have your application still working
  • A DR plan is important to increase the availability of your application
Attack protection: distributed global infrastructure is harder to attack

Global Applications in AWS:-
     Global DNS: Route 53
     Global Content Delivery Network (CDN): CloudFront
     S3 Transfer Acceleration
     AWS Global Accelerator

Custom Origin (HTTP):-
   Application Load Balancer
   EC2 instance
   S3 website (must first enable the bucket as a static S3 website)
   Any HTTP backend you want
   
CloudFront vs S3 Cross Region Replication:-
CloudFront:-
  • Global Edge network
  • Files are cached for a TTL (maybe a day)
  • Great for static content that must be available everywhere
  
S3 Cross Region Replication:
  • Must be setup for each region you want replication to happen
  • Files are updated in near real-time
  • Read only
  • Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions
  
S3 Transfer Acceleration:-

AWS Global Accelerator:-
Improve global application availability and performance using the AWS global network 

AWS Global Accelerator vs CloudFront:-
They both use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world
Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection.
CloudFront – Content Delivery Network:-
     • Improves performance for your cacheable content (such as images and videos)
     • Content is served at the edge
     
Global Accelerator:-
   • No caching, proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions.
   • Improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP
   • Good for HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses
   • Good for HTTP use cases that required deterministic, fast regional failover

AWS Outposts:-
Hybrid Cloud: businesses that keep an on-premises infrastructure alongside a cloud infrastructure
AWS Outposts are “server racks” that offers the same AWS infrastructure, services, APIs & tools to build your own applications on-premises just as in the cloud

Amazon SNS:-
The “event publishers” only sends message to one SNS topic
As many “event subscribers” as we want to listen to the SNS topic notifications

Amazon MQ:-
SQS, SNS are “cloud-native” services: proprietary protocols from AWS
Traditional applications running from on-premises may use open protocols such as: MQTT, AMQP, STOMP, Openwire, WSS
When migrating to the cloud, instead of re-engineering the application to use SQS and SNS, we can use Amazon MQ
Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for
Amazon MQ doesn’t “scale” as much as SQS / SNS
Amazon MQ runs on servers, can run in Multi-AZ with failover
Amazon MQ has both queue feature (~SQS) and topic features (~SNS)

Summary:-
SQS:-

VPC Peering:-
• Connect two VPC, privately using AWS’ network
• Make them behave as if they were in the same network
• Must not have overlapping CIDR (IP address range)
• VPC Peering connection is not transitive (must be established for each VPC that need to communicate with one another)

VPC Endpoints:-
Endpoints allow you to connect to AWS Services using a private network instead of the public www network
This gives you enhanced security and lower latency to access AWS services
VPC Endpoint Gateway: S3 & DynamoDB
VPC Endpoint Interface: the rest

Site to Site VPN & Direct Connect:-

penetration tests against their AWS infrastructure without prior approval for 8 services:
	Amazon EC2 instances, NAT Gateways, and Elastic Load Balancers
	Amazon RDS
	Amazon CloudFront
	Amazon Aurora
	Amazon API Gateways
	AWS Lambda and Lambda Edge functions
	Amazon Lightsail resources

Data at rest vs. Data in transit:-
• At rest: data stored or archived on a device
	• On a hard disk, on a RDS instance, in S3 Glacier Deep Archive, etc.
• In transit (in motion): data being moved from one location to another
	• Transfer from on-premises to AWS, EC2 to DynamoDB, etc.
	• Means data transferred on the network
• We want to encrypt data in both states to protect it!
• For this we leverage encryption keys

AWS KMS (Key Management Service):-
• Anytime you hear “encryption” for an AWS service, it’s most likely KMS
• KMS = AWS manages the encryption keys for us

	• S3 Glacier
	• Storage Gateway

CloudHSM:-
• KMS => AWS manages the software for encryption
• CloudHSM => AWS provisions encryption hardware

• AWS Managed Key:
	• Created, managed and used on the customer’s behalf by AWS
	• Used by AWS services (aws/s3, aws/ebs, aws/redshift)
• AWS Owned Key:
	• Collection of CMKs that an AWS service owns and manages to use in multiple accounts
	• AWS can use those to protect resources in your account (but you can’t view the keys)
• CloudHSM Keys (custom keystore):
	• Keys generated from your own CloudHSM hardware device
	• Cryptographic operations are performed within the CloudHSM cluster

AWS Cloud Best Practices – Design Principles:-
• Scalability: vertical & horizontal
• Disposable Resources: servers should be disposable & easily configured
• Automation: Serverless, Infrastructure as a Service, Auto Scaling…
• Loose Coupling:
	• Monolith are applications that do more and more over time, become bigger
	• Break it down into smaller, loosely coupled components
	• A change or a failure in one component should not cascade to other components
• Services, not Servers:
	• Don’t use just EC2
	• Use managed services, databases, serverless, etc !

Well Architected Framework 6 Pillars:-
	1) Operational Excellence
	2) Security
	3) Reliability

• Created by AWS Professionals by taking advantage of AWS Best Practices and lessons learned from 1000s of customers
• AWS CAF identifies specific organizational capabilities that underpin successful cloud transformations
• AWS CAF groups its capabilities in six perspectives: Business, People, Governance, Platform, Security, and Operations

CAF Perspectives and Foundational Capabilities Business Capabilities:-
• Business Perspective helps ensure that your cloud investments accelerate your digital transformation ambitions and business outcomes.
• People Perspective serves as a bridge between technology and business, accelerating the cloud journey to help organizations more rapidly evolve to a culture of continuous growth, learning, and where change becomes business-as-normal, with focus on culture, organizational structure, leadership, and workforce.
• Governance Perspective helps you orchestrate your cloud initiatives while maximizing organizational benefits and minimizing transformation- related risks.

CAF Perspectives and Foundational Capabilities Technical Capabilities:-
• Platform Perspective helps you build an enterprise-grade, scalable, hybrid cloud platform; modernize existing workloads; and implement new cloud-native solutions.
• Security Perspective helps you achieve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data and cloud workloads.
• Operations Perspective helps ensure that your cloud services are delivered at a level that meets the needs of your business.

AWS CAF – Transformation Domains:-
• Technology - using the cloud to migrate and modernize legacy infrastructure, applications, data and analytics platforms…
• Process - digitizing, automating, and optimizing your business operations
• leveraging new data and analytics platforms to create actionable insights
• using machine learning (ML) to improve your customer service experience…
• Organization - Reimagining your operating model
• Organizing your teams around products and value streams

AWS CAF – Transformation Phases:-
• Envision – demonstrate how the Cloud will accelerate business outcomes by identifying transformation opportunities and create a foundation for your digital transformation
• Align – identify capability gaps across the 6 AWS CAF Perspectives which results in an Action Plan
• Launch – build and deliver pilot initiatives in production and demonstrate incremental business value
• Scale – expand pilot initiatives to the desired scale while realizing the desired business benefits

AWS Right Sizing:-
• EC2 has many instance types, but choosing the most powerful instance type isn’t the best choice, because the cloud is elastic
• Right sizing is the process of matching instance types and sizes to your workload performance and capacity requirements at the lowest possible cost
• Scaling up is easy so always star t small
• It’s also the process of looking at deployed instances and identifying opportunities to eliminate or downsize without compromising capacity or other requirements, which results in lower costs
• It’s important to Right Size…
• before a Cloud Migration
• continuously after the cloud onboarding process (requirements change over time)
• CloudWatch, Cost Explorer, Trusted Advisor, 3 rd party tools can help

AWS Marketplace:-
• Digital catalog with thousands of software listings from independent software vendors (3 rd party)
• Example:
  	Custom AMI (custom OS, firewalls, technical solutions…)
	CloudFormation templates
	Software as a Service
