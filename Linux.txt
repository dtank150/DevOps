Linux:- 
Linux is an Operating System
Linux OS = Linux Distribution
○ Curated software
Distro / Flavor = Distribution

Linux Kernal:-
The kernel is the core.
● Linux Kernel + Apps = Distro

Linux Directory Structure:-
● Common Directories
/      -   “Root,” the top of the ﬁle system hierarchy.
/bin   -    Binaries and other executable programs.
/etc   -    System conﬁguration ﬁles.
/home  -    Home directories.
/opt   -    Optional or third party software.
/tmp   -    Temporary space, typically cleared on reboot.
/usr   -    User related programs
/var   -    Variable data, most notably log ﬁles.

● Comprehensive Directory Listing

Basic Linux Commands
● ls - Lists directory contents.
● cd - Changes the current directory.
● pwd - Displays the present working directory.
● cat - Concatenates and displays files.
● echo - Displays arguments to the screen.
● man - Displays the online manual.
● exit - Exits the shell or your current session.
● clear - Clears the screen.

ls Options
-l long listing format

man Keyboard Commands
space - display the next page
q - quit

Directories
● Are Containers for other files and directories.
● Provide a tree like structure.
● Can be accessed by name or shortcut.

Directory Shortcuts
. This directory
.. The parent directory
cd - Change to the previous directory

Directory Separator
/ Directory separator (forward slash)

Creating and Removing Directories
mkdir [-p] directory - Create a directory.
rmdir [-p] directory - Remove a directory.
rm -rf directory - Recursively removes directory.

Listing All Files, Including Hidden Files
Hidden ﬁles begin with a period.
    Sometimes called “dot ﬁles.”
Hidden ﬁles are not displayed by default.
To show hidden ﬁles with ls, use ls -a.
Command options can be combined.
    ls -l -a is the same as ls -la and ls -al.

Listing Files by Type
Use ls -F to reveal ﬁle types.
/ - Directory
@ - Link
* - Executable

Symbolic Links
A link points to the actual ﬁle or directory.
Use the link as if it were the ﬁle.
A link can be used to create a shortcut.
    - Use for long ﬁle or directory names.
    - Use to indicate the current version of software.

Listing Files by Time and in Reverse
ls -t List ﬁles by time.
ls -r Reverse order.
ls -latr Long listing including all ﬁles reverse sorted by time.

Listing Files Recursively
ls -R Lists ﬁles recursively

The tree Command
Similar to ls -R, but creates visual output.
tree -d  List directories only.
tree -C  Colorize output.

List Directories, Not Contents
ls -d  List directory name, not contents.

Listing Files with Color
ls --color  Colorize the output.

Working with Spaces in Names
Just say no to spaces!
Alternatives:
    Hyphens ( - )
    Underscores ( _ )
    CamelCase

Working with Spaces in Names
Encapsulate the entire ﬁle name in quotes.
Use a backslash (\) to escape spaces.

Permissions - Files vs Directories

Permission               File                       Directory
Read (r)        Allows a file to be read.     Allows file names in the directory to be read.
Write (w)       Allows a file to modified.    Allows entries to be modified within the directory.
Execute (x)     Allows the execution of a     Allows access to contents and metadata for entries.
                file.                       

Permission Categories
Symbol Category
 u      User
 g      Group
 o      Other
 a      All

Groups
● Every user is in at least one group.
● Users can belong to many groups.
● Groups are used to organize users.
● The groups command displays a user’s groups.
● You can also use id -Gn.

Changing Permissions
Item    Meaning
chmod   Change mode command
ugoa    User category user, group, other, all
+-=     Add, subtract, or set permissions
rwx     Read, Write, Execute

Numeric Based Permissions
r w x 
0 0 0 Value for off
1 1 1 Binary value for on
4 2 1 Base 10 value for on

Order Has Meaning
          U    G   O
Symbolic rwx  r-x  r--
Binary   111  101  100
Decimal   7    5    4

Commonly Used Permissions
Symbolic        Octal
-rwx------      700
-rwxr-xr-x      755
-rw-rw-r--      664
-rw-rw----      660
-rw-r--r--      644

The chgrp command changes the group.
Directory Permissions Revisited
● Permissions on a directory can effect the files in the directory.
● If the file permissions look correct, start checking directory permissions.
● Work your way up to the root.

File Creation Mask
● File creation mask determines default permissions.
● If no mask were used permissions would be:
        ○ 777 for directories
        ○ 666 for files

The umask Command
umask [-S] [mode]
● Sets the file creation mask to mode, if given.
● Use -S to for symbolic notation.

                    Directory       File
Base Permission      777            666
Subtract Umask      -022            -022
Creations Permission 755            644

                    Directory       File
Base Permission         777         666
Subtract Umask          -002        -002
Creations Permission     775         664

Octal Subtraction Is an Estimation
                    Directory       File
Base Permission         777         666
Subtract Umask          -007        -007
Creations Permission     770        660 *

Common umask modes
● 022
● 002
● 077
● 007

Special Modes
● umask 0022 is the same as umask 022
● chmod 0644 is the same as chmod 644
● The special modes are:
        ○ setuid
        ○ setgid
        ○ sticky
